1.starts by clearing the working space.
2. adds to the search path the path 'utilities'. Not sure this function call does anything
3.set name to demoMovie.tif, sframe to 1, and num2read to 2000.
4. if Y is not a double, convert to double. Not sure about the point of this functions,
since Y should be a matrix containing binary info. Wouldn't changing the form affect the data?
5.get the dimensions of Y.
6. calculate the total number of pixels
7.Set parameters for the algorithm
8.preprocess Y (in depth analysis in its own doc)
9.initialize components using initialize_components().%is this the identifying neurons part?
10.display the centers of found components.
11.(optional) manually refine components
12.update spatial components
13.update temporal components.
14.classify components.
15.(optional) run GUI for modifying component selection.
16. merge found components.
17.flag for displaying merging example.
18.refine estimates excluding rejected components.
19.restore AR values.
20.plot
    order components
    extract DF/F values (optional)
    contour plot for spatial footprint.
21.display components
22.make movie
